# Documents

Some documents or templates for documents in *LaTeX* or *Markdown* (or
*OpenOffice*).

## Google Muddle (google-muddle)
Is a little modul thesis I made for ZHAW (it's just the document, no
implementation). The graphics are made with *Dia*, everything else is *LaTeX*,
except for the presentation which I made with *OpenOffice*.

## Letters (letters)
These are two templates for A4 sized letters that match in a envelope with
address window. It's extended *Markdown* and converted to *PDF* with *Pandoc*.
